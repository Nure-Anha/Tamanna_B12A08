App Name: 
AppVibe - A Modern App Store Experience.



Description: 
AppVibe is a fully responsive React-based web application that represents a modern app store platform. 
Users can explore a collection of apps, view detailed information like downloads, ratings, and reviews, and also install or uninstall apps, which also removes them from Local storage.
It also includes navigation, live search, filtering, sorting, and real-time loading animations to ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.



Technologies: 
For the Frontend Part, I use the following technologies -
1. React.js for components and hooks
2. Tailwind CSS for design and responsive
3. Daisy UI for buttons and other designs
4. Recharts for chart visualization
5. React Toastify for success, warning toasts
6. JSON for self-made API data
7. Vite for Project setup
8. GitHub and Netlify for deployment
